cURL notes from practice

* Using cURL with a URL will get you the HTML of the page
* GET method is implied when no other method is specified (means to read)
* Four HTTP methods
	- POST
	- GET
	- PUT
	- DELETE
* -I limits the response to just the header
	- -i shows the header along with all the HTML of website
* -X signifies the method used for the request
	- typically curl -X GET http...
		> can also be represented as curl --get http...
